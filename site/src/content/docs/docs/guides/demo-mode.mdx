Demo mode provides simulated data for developing and testing the Oore web dashboard without configuring real GitHub or GitLab integrations.

## Enabling Demo Mode

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
OORE_DEMO_MODE=true
OORE_DEV_MODE=true  # Required to allow HTTP admin endpoints
```

Restart the server to apply changes.

## What Demo Mode Provides

When enabled, the server returns fake data for all API endpoints:

### Integrations

| Integration | Demo Data |
|-------------|-----------|
| GitHub App | Pre-configured "Oore CI Demo" app with 3 installations |
| GitLab | 2 connected instances (gitlab.com and self-hosted) |

### Repositories

12 demo repositories with a mix of:
- GitHub and GitLab providers
- Various languages (Flutter, React Native, Swift, Kotlin)
- Active and inactive states
- Different default branches

### Builds

20+ builds with:
- All status types (success, failure, running, pending, cancelled)
- Various trigger types (push, pull_request, manual)
- Realistic commit SHAs and branch names
- Workflow names and config sources

### Build Steps

Each build includes 6 realistic steps:
- Checkout
- Install Dependencies
- Analyze Code
- Run Tests
- Build App
- Deploy (conditional)

Steps include:
- Duration and timing
- Exit codes
- Status badges
- ANSI-colored log output

### Pipeline Configurations

Repositories alternate between:
- **YAML format** — Codemagic-compatible workflow configuration
- **HUML format** — Human-oriented Markup Language configuration

## UI Indicators

When demo mode is active:

1. **Header Badge** — An amber "Demo Mode" badge appears in the dashboard header
2. **Settings Alert** — The settings page shows a prominent demo mode notice

## Use Cases

- **Frontend Development** — Build and test UI components without backend setup
- **Design Reviews** — Showcase the dashboard with realistic data
- **Testing** — Verify UI behavior with various data states
- **Documentation** — Create screenshots with consistent demo data

## Limitations

Demo mode is read-only for integration endpoints:

- Cannot create/delete GitHub Apps or GitLab credentials
- Cannot trigger real builds
- Cannot save pipeline configurations (validation works, save is mocked)

<Aside type="caution">
Demo mode is for development only. Never enable in production as it bypasses real authentication and data.
</Aside>

## Disabling Demo Mode

Remove or set to false:

```bash
OORE_DEMO_MODE=false
```

Restart the server. Real database data will be used for all endpoints.

## Installation Issues

### Rust build fails with "linker error"

Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Permission denied when installing service

The `install` command requires sudo:

```bash
sudo ./target/release/oored install
```

### "bun: command not found" after install

Restart your terminal or source your shell config:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Build Issues

### Build fails with "flutter: command not found"

The oored service needs Flutter in its PATH. Add to `/etc/oore/oore.env`:

```bash
PATH=/usr/local/flutter/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

Then restart the service:

```bash
sudo oored restart
```

### iOS build fails with "No signing identity found"

1. Check certificates are in Keychain:
   ```bash
   security find-identity -v -p codesigning
   ```

2. Ensure the oored service has Keychain access
3. Upload certificate via the dashboard: Settings -> iOS Signing

### Clone fails for private repository

**GitHub:** Verify the GitHub App installation has access to the repository.

**GitLab:** Check the OAuth token has `read_repository` scope and hasn't expired.

## Service Issues

### Service fails to start

Check the logs:

```bash
oored logs -f
# or
sudo cat /var/log/oore/oored.log
```

**Common causes:**
- Port 8080 already in use: `lsof -i :8080`
- Missing encryption key in config
- Database file permissions

### "Connection refused" from web dashboard

1. Verify the server is running: `oored status`
2. Check the API URL in `web/.env.local` matches `OORE_BASE_URL`
3. Ensure no firewall is blocking port 8080

### Webhooks not triggering builds

<Steps>
1. Verify webhook URL is reachable from the internet
2. Check webhook secret matches in repository settings
3. Review webhook events in the dashboard
4. Check logs for signature verification errors
</Steps>

## Database Issues

### "database is locked"

SQLite allows only one writer at a time. This usually indicates:
- Multiple oored processes running
- Long-running transaction blocking writes

Fix: Restart the service: `sudo oored restart`

### Migrating database

The database auto-migrates on startup. To manually run migrations:

```bash
cargo run -p oore-server -- migrate
```

---

## OAuth Issues

### GitHub App setup fails

1. Ensure `OORE_BASE_URL` is set correctly
2. The callback URL must be reachable by GitHub
3. Check logs for the specific error

### GitLab token expired

Refresh the token in Settings -> GitLab, or the system will auto-refresh if `GITLAB_SERVER_PEPPER` is configured.

## How It Works

Install the `oored` server on a Mac mini or Mac Studio. Control it remotely using the `oore` CLI or web dashboard from anywhere. GitHub and GitLab webhooks trigger builds automatically.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Server on Your Mac" icon="server">
    `oored` runs on your Mac hardware. It receives webhooks, executes builds, and stores artifacts locally.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI from Anywhere" icon="laptop">
    `oore` is a lightweight HTTP client. Run it from your laptop, a CI runner, or any machine with network access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credentials Stay Put" icon="lock">
    Signing certificates and provisioning profiles remain in Keychain. They're never uploaded to a third party.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Predictable Costs" icon="seti:config">
    Fixed hardware investment. No per-minute billing, no shared queues, no surprises.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why Not Hosted CI?

Hosted CI services require uploading your signing credentials and running builds on shared infrastructure. Your code and secrets leave your network.

With Oore, everything stays on hardware you control. Your Mac mini in the closet becomes a dedicated build server that you access remotely.

<Aside type="note" title="Alpha Status">
Build execution, code signing, and artifact storage all work. You can trigger builds from GitHub/GitLab, see logs, download artifacts, and sign your apps. What's next: app store distribution. See the [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap/) for details.

## The Problem with Hosted CI

With services like Codemagic or Bitrise, you:

1. **Upload your signing credentials** — certificates, provisioning profiles, API keys
2. **Run builds on their machines** — your code executes in their cloud
3. **Pay per build minute** — costs scale with usage
4. **Wait in shared queues** — builds compete for resources

For many teams, this works fine. But if you care about security, cost, or control, there's friction.

## Oore's Approach

**Your Mac is the CI server.** Install `oored` on a Mac mini or Mac Studio, and it becomes a private build hub:

- **Credentials stay local** — signing certs live in Keychain, never uploaded anywhere
- **Code stays local** — source never leaves your network
- **Fixed cost** — no per-minute billing, build as much as you want
- **Dedicated resources** — no waiting in queues

You control it remotely via the web dashboard from anywhere.

## How It Works

### Two Components

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="oored (server)" icon="server">
    The HTTP server daemon that runs **on your Mac**. Receives webhooks, executes builds, stores artifacts, serves the API. This is the brain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web Dashboard" icon="external">
    Browser-based UI for managing repositories, builds, and settings. Same capabilities as the API, visual interface.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

The key insight: **the server must run on the Mac** (that's where Keychain and Xcode live), but **the dashboard can be accessed from anywhere** that can reach it over HTTP.

## Comparison

| | Hosted CI | Oore |
|---|-----------|------|
| **Credentials** | Uploaded to their cloud | Stay in your Keychain |
| **Code** | Runs on shared VMs | Runs on your hardware |
| **Cost** | Per build minute | Fixed hardware cost |
| **Queue** | Shared with others | Dedicated to you |
| **Control** | Their policies | Your rules |

## Current Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Webhook ingestion (GitHub/GitLab) | ✅ Works |
| Repository management | ✅ Works |
| Service management | ✅ Works |
| REST API | ✅ Works |
| Web dashboard UI | ✅ Works |
| Build execution | ✅ Works |
| Build logs | ✅ Works |
| Code signing (iOS/Android) | ✅ Works |
| Artifact storage | ✅ Works |
| App Store/Play Store publishing | 🚧 Not started |
| Notifications (Slack/email) | 🚧 Not started |

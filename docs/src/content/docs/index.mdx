## Why Self-Hosted?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Credentials Stay Local" icon="lock">
    No uploading certificates or provisioning profiles to third parties. Your code signing credentials never leave your network.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dedicated Hardware" icon="server">
    Faster, predictable builds on Apple Silicon you own. No waiting in shared queues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Per-Build Costs" icon="star">
    Fixed hardware cost vs. pay-per-minute cloud builds. Build as much as you want.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Control" icon="setting">
    Your code never leaves your network. Complete control over your build environment.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why Self-Hosted?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Credentials Stay Local" icon="lock">
    No uploading certificates or provisioning profiles to third parties. Your code signing credentials never leave your network.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dedicated Hardware" icon="server">
    Faster, predictable builds on Apple Silicon you own. No waiting in shared queues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Per-Build Costs" icon="star">
    Fixed hardware cost vs. pay-per-minute cloud builds. Build as much as you want.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Control" icon="setting">
    Your code never leaves your network. Complete control over your build environment.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Project Status

**Very early development** — I'm still figuring out the architecture. The core feature (build execution) doesn't exist yet.

What's scaffolded (not production-ready):
- ✅ GitHub/GitLab webhook ingestion
- ✅ Repository and build database models
- ✅ Service management basics
- ✅ Web dashboard UI shell

What doesn't exist:
- ❌ **Actual build execution**
- ❌ Code signing / Keychain
- ❌ Artifact storage
- ❌ App Store publishing

Oore is a **self-hosted Codemagic alternative** — a Flutter-focused CI/CD platform that runs on your own Mac hardware (Mac mini, Mac Studio) instead of cloud infrastructure.

## Why Oore?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Signing credentials stay local" icon="lock">
    No uploading certificates or provisioning profiles to third parties.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dedicated hardware" icon="server">
    Faster, predictable builds on Apple Silicon you own.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No per-build costs" icon="star">
    Fixed hardware cost vs. pay-per-minute cloud builds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full control" icon="setting">
    Your code never leaves your network.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

Oore consists of three main components:

1. **oored** — The server daemon that receives webhooks, manages builds, and executes pipelines
2. **oore** — The CLI client for managing repositories and builds
3. **web** — The dashboard for team-friendly build management (coming soon)

    ⚠️ <strong>Experimental</strong> — This project is in very early development. Do not use for real projects.

<Aside type="caution" title="Not Ready for Use">
This is an experimental project. The core functionality (build execution) hasn't been implemented yet. I'm still evaluating architecture approaches. If you're interested in the concept, star the repo and check back later.
</Aside>

Oore is a **self-hosted Codemagic alternative** — a Flutter-focused CI/CD platform that runs on your own Mac hardware (Mac mini, Mac Studio) instead of cloud infrastructure.

## Why Oore?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Signing credentials stay local" icon="lock">
    No uploading certificates or provisioning profiles to third parties.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dedicated hardware" icon="server">
    Faster, predictable builds on Apple Silicon you own.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No per-build costs" icon="star">
    Fixed hardware cost vs. pay-per-minute cloud builds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full control" icon="setting">
    Your code never leaves your network.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

Oore consists of three main components:

1. **oored** — The server daemon that receives webhooks, manages builds, and executes pipelines
2. **oore** — The CLI client for managing repositories and builds
3. **web** — The dashboard for team-friendly build management (coming soon)

## Current Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Webhook ingestion | ✅ Scaffolded |
| Repository models | ✅ Scaffolded |
| Service management | ✅ Scaffolded |
| Web dashboard UI | ✅ Scaffolded |
| **Build execution** | ❌ Not started |
| Code signing | ❌ Not started |
| Artifact storage | ❌ Not started |
| Distribution | ❌ Not started |

The "scaffolded" items are basic plumbing — not production-ready.

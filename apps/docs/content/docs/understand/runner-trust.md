title: 'How Oore trusts Direct macOS runners'
status: implemented
description: 'Understand repository trust, runner placement, claim eligibility, and the limits of direct execution.'
---

A Direct macOS runner executes repositories that an owner or admin has chosen
to trust. It is a compatibility-first build executor, not a sandbox for
hostile repository code.

## Source linking is the trust decision

Creating a project or changing its linked source authorizes that repository's
checkout, dependencies, and commands to run with the Direct runner account's
permissions. Oore does not ask for a second per-repository execution approval.

Verified GitHub and GitLab events can create work only for an immutable
revision that belongs to the linked repository. External-fork and ambiguous
revisions are ignored rather than executed automatically.

## The runner is a separate process

The default installer enrolls a managed Direct macOS runner on the backend Mac.
An operator may instead register a runner on another Mac. In both placements:

- `oored` remains the backend authority
- the runner token identifies the runner
- protocol compatibility and job assignment are checked before work is
  returned
- repository commands run with the runner's macOS account permissions

The backend returns the registration token once, and the CLI stores it in the
runner configuration without displaying it. Protect that configuration.
Embedded and hybrid execution are unavailable.

## Eligibility is not another trust grant

Before a runner claims queued work, the backend checks that the instance is
accepting new builds and the linked source remains available. The
**Allow approved repositories** control under **Settings > Runners** pauses or
resumes new claims.

Turning it off lets active work drain and leaves queued work waiting. It does
not cancel active jobs, revoke a project's repository trust, or introduce a
second approval list.

## Each job stays bound to its source

A claimed job carries the repository identity, pinned revision, selected
pipeline information, and a scoped signing capability. The runner retrieves
signing material through assignment-bound paths rather than placing those
values in repository configuration.

If an operator relinks the project, queued work for the previous repository is
canceled. Already-active work keeps its build-bound identity instead of
silently switching repositories.

## Defense-in-depth has a limit

Oore uses private workspaces, a job-bound checkout proxy for GitLab,
managed-environment scrubbing, runner-owned signing, output verification, and
cleanup to reduce accidental leakage. Those controls do not isolate malicious
code already trusted to run under the same macOS account.

A dedicated non-admin runner account reduces the host authority available to a
build. Strong isolation for untrusted contributions requires disposable macOS
virtual machines and is outside the supported V1 runner model.

## What this means for you

- Link only repositories you would run directly under the runner account.
- Treat source relinking as a new execution trust decision.
- Protect the runner token and the network path to a runner on another Mac.
- Use the operational pause to drain work, not as a repository approval
  mechanism.
- Do not rely on Direct mode to contain hostile dependencies or build scripts.

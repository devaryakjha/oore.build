title: 'How a build moves from queue to artifact'
status: implemented
description: 'Follow the decisions and boundaries between a build request, runner execution, and an available artifact.'
---

A build is a request tied to one project, pipeline, repository identity, and
revision. Oore preserves those choices while the build moves through the
backend, a Direct macOS runner, and artifact storage.

## From request to eligible work

A manual action, verified source event, or API request creates the build. Oore
resolves the requested branch to a commit unless the request already pins one,
then records the pipeline and repository identity for that build.

The build waits in the queue until:

- the instance allows new work
- the linked source is still available
- a compatible Direct macOS runner can claim it

Turning off **Allow approved repositories** is an operational pause. Active
work drains, while eligible queued work waits. The control does not revoke
repository trust.

## The runner executes the pinned checkout

After a claim, the Direct macOS runner checks out the build's pinned revision
and chooses its pipeline configuration from that checkout. It prepares the
selected Flutter toolchain, runs the repository stages, and streams logs back
to the backend.

Repository commands run in order. A non-zero command result stops later
repository stages and makes the build fail. Cancellation can also win while
work is queued, scheduled, assigned, or running; a claimed runner observes the
canceled state and stops.

After a supported build command produces an Android or iOS output, runner-owned
signing may sign and verify that output before later repository stages such as
`post_build` run. Signing remains outside the repository child process, but it
is not guaranteed to wait until every repository command has finished.

## Outputs become artifacts

Only after the remaining repository stages succeed, the runner:

1. finds files that match the pipeline's artifact patterns
2. reserves an upload with the backend
3. uploads each output through the configured storage path
4. finalizes successful uploads before reporting completion

Pending or failed uploads are not downloadable. When a pipeline declares
artifact patterns, missing matches or failed finalization prevent that
artifact-producing build from succeeding.

## Results and retention are different moments

The execution result can be `succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`, or `timed_out`.
Retention may later move a completed record and its artifact availability to
`expired`, so a successful historical build does not imply that its files are
still downloadable.

Changing a project's linked source does not rewrite an active build's checkout
identity. Queued work tied to the previous source is canceled rather than
silently running a different repository.

## What this means for you

- The build detail's commit is the revision the runner uses.
- Pipeline edits made later do not retarget an already-created build.
- Pausing new claims does not cancel work that is already active.
- Runner-owned signing can happen before later `post_build` repository
  commands.
- A green command sequence is not enough when required artifacts cannot be
  collected and finalized.
- Artifact expiry is a retention outcome, not a new execution failure.

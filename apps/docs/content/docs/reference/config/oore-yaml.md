status: implemented
description: 'The strict repository-owned pipeline configuration schema used by Oore runners.'
---

Place `.oore.yaml` in the repository root to keep pipeline execution settings
with the code they build. `.oore.yml` is also recognized.

```yaml
version: 1

platforms:
  - android
  - ios

flutter_version: '3.24.5'

commands:
  pre_build:
    - flutter pub get
  post_build:
    - echo "Build complete"

platform_build_args:
  android:
    - '--split-per-abi'

env:
  - key: BUILD_FLAVOR
    value: staging

artifacts:
  patterns:
    - 'build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/*.apk'
    - 'build/ios/ipa/*.ipa'
```

The schema rejects unknown fields.

## Top-level fields

| Field                 | Type     | Required | Default                         |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `version`             | integer  | Yes      | Must be `1`                     |
| `platforms`           | string[] | Yes      | No default; must not be empty   |
| `flutter_version`     | string   | No       | Oore-managed stable Flutter     |
| `commands`            | object   | No       | Empty stages                    |
| `platform_build_args` | object   | No       | Empty arrays                    |
| `platform_commands`   | object   | No       | No overrides                    |
| `env`                 | object[] | No       | `[]`                            |
| `artifacts`           | object   | No       | Platform-specific default globs |

`platforms` accepts `android`, `ios`, and `macos`.

## Commands

`commands` accepts three string arrays:

| Field        | Timing                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `pre_build`  | Before the main or platform-specific build |
| `build`      | Shared main build commands                 |
| `post_build` | After successful build commands            |

All stages are optional, including `commands.build`. Commands run in order and
an empty command string is invalid.

`platform_build_args.android`, `.ios`, and `.macos` are arrays appended to
Oore's default command for that platform. `platform_commands` accepts one
complete command string for each platform instead. A platform command replaces
the default command, so build arguments for that same platform are not applied.

For a run that may select only some configured platforms, use platform
commands or Oore defaults. A shared non-empty `commands.build` list is not
assigned to an arbitrary platform during a partial run.

## Environment

Each `env` item contains a `key` and `value`:

```yaml
env:
  - key: JAVA_HOME
    value: /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
```

Keys must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` and must be unique. These values are
repository-owned build inputs; do not put credentials in the file.
Oore-managed signing credentials are injected only into the signing seam and
are scrubbed from repository command stages.

## Artifacts

When `artifacts` is omitted, Oore derives default patterns from `platforms`.
When it is present, `artifacts.patterns` replaces those defaults.

Patterns:

- must contain `*` or `?`
- must be at most 512 characters
- use `/` and stay relative to the workspace
- cannot contain empty, `.` or `..` path segments
- use `**` to cross directory boundaries

A filename-only pattern such as `*.apk` matches that filename pattern anywhere
in the workspace.

## Resolution

When a pipeline pins an explicit repository config path, Oore checks only that
path. Otherwise it checks `.oore.yaml` and then `.oore.yml`. If no candidate
file exists, Oore uses the UI execution configuration. If a candidate exists
but cannot be read or validated, the build fails instead of falling back.

The runner reads the file from the pinned checkout used for the build. A
`.fvmrc` value takes precedence over `flutter_version` from whichever
configuration source is active. A repository file replaces the UI execution
configuration for that run.

Validate the file before committing:

```bash
oore pipeline validate .oore.yaml
```

See [Configure a repository pipeline](/build/pipelines/oore-yaml) for the task
and [`oore pipeline validate`](/reference/cli/oore-pipeline-validate) for the
command contract.

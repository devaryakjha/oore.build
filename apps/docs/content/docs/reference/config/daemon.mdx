`oored` is the Oore backend daemon. A foreground process accepts two runtime
options:

```text
oored run [--listen <HOST:PORT>] [--state-file <PATH>]
```

`--listen` defaults to `127.0.0.1:8787` and maps to `OORED_LISTEN_ADDR`.
`--state-file` overrides `OORE_SETUP_STATE_FILE` and the default database path.

Use the supported installer to create or update a managed service. The
low-level `oored install-service` and `oored uninstall-service` commands are
implementation seams, not public privileged deployment recipes.

## Data layout

The data root resolves in this order:

1. `OORED_DATA_DIR`
2. `OORE_DATA_DIR`
3. The platform data directory plus `oore`

On macOS, the default is `~/Library/Application Support/oore`.

| Path                         | Purpose                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `<data-root>/oore.db`        | SQLite state and application data  |
| `<data-root>/encryption.key` | Encryption key for secrets at rest |
| `<data-root>/artifacts`      | Default local artifact storage     |

`OORE_SETUP_STATE_FILE` changes only the SQLite path; the daemon key remains in
the data root. The public backup workflow supports the default managed layout.
Do not use manual `oore backup create --state-file` for a custom database/key
layout: that option selects the database but does not select its matching key.

## Network settings

External Access network settings are primarily stored in the database and
managed in the UI. When no saved value exists, the daemon can use
`OORE_PUBLIC_URL`, `OORE_ARTIFACT_DELIVERY_URL`, `OORE_CORS_ORIGINS`, and the
legacy single-origin `OORE_CORS_ORIGIN` fallback.

The default allowed browser origins are:

```text
http://localhost:3000
http://127.0.0.1:3000
http://localhost:4173
http://127.0.0.1:4173
```

The hosted UI is a UI-only client and is not an implicit CORS origin. Add its
exact origin to the allowed origins when using it with External Access.

When the daemon binds a private non-loopback IPv4 or IPv6 address, it also
keeps a loopback listener on the same port for the local CLI and managed
runner.

## Runner boundary

Build execution is not embedded in `oored`. Omit `OORED_RUNNER_MODE` or set it
to `external`; `embedded` and `hybrid` are rejected. Add a supported Direct
macOS runner through [Add a Direct macOS runner](/operate/runners/direct).

## Artifact storage

Local storage is the default. The S3-compatible adapter uses
`OORE_S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optional
`OORE_S3_ENDPOINT` and `OORE_S3_REGION`. Prefer the saved storage settings and
the [artifact storage task](/operate/storage/artifacts) for a managed
configuration.

See [Environment variables](/reference/config/environment) for the complete
public runtime variable groups.

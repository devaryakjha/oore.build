Oore API errors use one JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "error": "Project not found",
  "code": "not_found",
  "details": "Optional additional context"
}
```

| Field     | Type     | Meaning                                                      |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `error`   | `string` | Human-readable explanation suitable for logs or a UI         |
| `code`    | `string` | Stable machine-readable value for branching in client code   |
| `details` | `string` | Optional context; do not parse this field as a stable schema |

## Interpret an error

Use the HTTP status for the broad outcome and `code` for the exact condition.
Do not infer one global status from a code name: the operation contract defines
the valid responses for that path.

For example, project-scoped authorization deliberately distinguishes:

| Status | Code                | Meaning                                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `404`  | `not_found`         | The project does not exist or the caller has no membership to discover it |
| `403`  | `permission_denied` | The caller can discover the project but lacks the requested permission    |

Artifact delivery can return `410` with `artifact_expired` after retention has
removed an artifact. A build status update can return `409` with
`invalid_transition` when the requested state change is not allowed.

These examples are intentionally not an exhaustive code list. Oore defines
errors alongside their handlers, and the public API grows without requiring a
separate hand-maintained registry.

## Find operation-specific responses

Open the relevant generated page from [HTTP API](/reference/api). Each
operation page is generated from the checked-in OpenAPI contract and shows its
documented status codes and response schemas.

Treat an unrecognized code as an operation failure, preserve it in logs, and
surface `error` to the operator. Clients should not turn unknown codes into a
successful or empty result.

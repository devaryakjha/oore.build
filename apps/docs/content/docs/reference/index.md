Use these pages when you need an exact value, field, command, or machine
contract. For an outcome-driven walkthrough, start with a task or tutorial
instead.

## Product contracts

- [Error codes](/reference/errors) explains the API error envelope and how to
  interpret operation-specific codes.
- [Build states](/reference/build-states) defines every build status and valid
  transition.
- [Setup states](/reference/setup-states) defines the setup status returned by
  an Oore backend.
- [Roles and permissions](/reference/roles) maps instance and project roles to
  their effective access.

## Commands and configuration

- [`oore` command reference](/reference/cli) covers the operator CLI.
- [`.oore.yaml`](/reference/config/oore-yaml) defines repository pipeline
  configuration.
- [Daemon configuration](/reference/config/daemon) and
  [environment variables](/reference/config/environment) cover runtime
  configuration.
- [Installer configuration](/reference/config/installer) covers release,
  install-role, and automation inputs.

## HTTP API

[HTTP API](/reference/api) is the authored entry point to the generated
OpenAPI reference. The generated category and operation pages are the
authoritative inventory of paths, authentication, request bodies, and
responses.

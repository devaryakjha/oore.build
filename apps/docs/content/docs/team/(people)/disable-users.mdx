title: 'Disable or restore a user'
description: 'Stop an Oore user from signing in, then restore the same account when access is needed again.'
status: implemented

Disable a user's Oore account without deleting the account, its role, or its project history. Disabling immediately revokes the user's active sessions and API tokens.

Restoring the user makes the same account active again. Previously revoked sessions and tokens stay revoked.

## What you need

- An Owner or Admin account
- The Owner account if the target user is an Admin

You cannot disable yourself or the Owner.

## 1. Disable the user

1. Open **Settings > Users**.
2. Open **Actions** for the user.
3. Select **Disable user**.
4. Review the confirmation, then select **Disable**.

The user's status changes to `disabled`. Existing sessions stop working, and non-revoked API tokens owned by the user are revoked.

Disabling is different from removing project access:

- **Disable user** stops all Oore access for the account.
- **Remove access** on a project removes only that project's membership.
- Neither action deletes builds, artifacts, or audit history.

## 2. Restore the user

1. In **Settings > Users**, find the user with the `disabled` status.
2. Open **Actions**.
3. Select **Re-enable user**.

The status changes to `active`. The user must sign in again, and they must create replacement API tokens if needed.

## Verify the result

- After disabling, Oore shows `<email> has been disabled`, and the user's row shows `disabled`.
- A request using one of the user's old sessions or API tokens no longer succeeds.
- After restoring, Oore shows `<email> has been re-enabled`, and the row shows `active`.
- The user can complete a fresh sign-in through the configured authentication path.

## Troubleshooting

### The action is not available

Oore hides actions for your own account and the Owner. An Admin also cannot manage another Admin; use the Owner account.

### The restored user still cannot sign in

Their old session was revoked and cannot be restored. Start a new OIDC or Trusted Proxy sign-in and confirm that the authenticated email still matches the Oore user.

### The user should lose only one project

Do not disable the account. Open that project's **Settings** tab and use **Remove access** in **Project access**.

## Next step

[Review roles and project access](/team/roles) before granting the restored user new permissions.

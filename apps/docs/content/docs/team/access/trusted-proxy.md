title: 'Configure External Access (Trusted Proxy)'
description: 'Initialize Oore behind an authentication proxy with an allowlisted peer, identity header, and shared proof.'
status: implemented
---

Configure a fresh Oore instance to accept identities from an upstream authentication proxy. Oore creates the real Owner and reaches `ready`; it does not create a placeholder account.

Trusted Proxy is an advanced deployment mode. A forwarded email header is never sufficient by itself: the immediate peer CIDR, configured identity header, and shared proof must all pass.

This direct host initialization task applies before an instance is ready. It refuses to convert or overwrite a ready Local Only or OIDC instance.

## What you need

- The customer-operated macOS backend with `oored` installed
- An upstream proxy that authenticates each person and overwrites the identity header
- A protected non-loopback path from that proxy to Oore
- The immediate proxy or frontend peer CIDR as seen by `oored`
- A strong backend proof in a file readable only by the Oore operator
- The initial Owner email, exactly as the proxy will send it

Oore does not configure or certify your proxy, DNS, TLS, VPN, tunnel, mesh, or firewall.

## 1. Define the trust boundary

Choose the identity header:

- `x-oore-user-email` for a generic proxy;
- `x-warpgate-username` for the Warpgate preset; or
- a custom header that contains the authenticated user's email.

Configure the proxy to overwrite that header after authentication. Do not pass through a browser-supplied value.

Record the CIDR of the process that connects directly to `oored`. An upstream network's CIDR does not help if a separate frontend proxy is the immediate peer.

## 2. Prepare the backend proof

Create a strong secret using your approved secret-management process and save it in a file with `0600` permissions. The request path to `oored` must supply that value as `x-oore-trusted-proxy-secret`.

If `oore-web` creates a second proxy hop, use two different proofs:

- one proof from the upstream authentication proxy to `oore-web`; and
- another proof from `oore-web` to `oored`.

Never reuse one value across both boundaries. The supported frontend pairing flow can provision the backend proof without exposing it to the browser-facing proxy.

## 3. Initialize the backend

Start `oored` once so its database migrations exist, then run:

```bash
oore setup init \
  --mode trusted-proxy \
  --owner-email <owner-email> \
  --user-email-header <identity-header> \
  --trusted-proxy-cidr <immediate-peer-cidr> \
  --shared-secret-file <backend-proof-file>
```

Replace:

- `<owner-email>` with the exact first Owner identity;
- `<identity-header>` with your selected header;
- `<immediate-peer-cidr>` with the immediate peer CIDR; and
- `<backend-proof-file>` with the proof file's absolute path.

Repeat `--trusted-proxy-cidr` for each intentional immediate peer. With no CIDR flag, only loopback peers are trusted.

The command prints `State: ready` and `Mode: remote trusted-proxy` when initialization succeeds.

## 4. Complete the proxy path

Configure the trusted process to:

1. authenticate the person;
2. overwrite the configured identity header with their email;
3. connect from an allowlisted immediate peer; and
4. supply the matching shared proof on the protected hop.

Expose the browser-visible service over HTTPS. Keep all non-loopback hops protected.

Oore uses the email only to find or activate an Oore user. It does not import proxy groups or assign Oore roles from them.

## 5. Save the browser-visible network settings

Sign in through the protected proxy as the Owner, then:

1. Open **Settings > General**.
2. Under **External access**, select **Network settings**.
3. Set **Public URL (HTTPS)** to the browser-visible Oore URL.
4. Add the exact browser origin under **Allowed frontend origins**.
5. Select **Save network settings**.

## Verify the result

1. Open the proxy-protected Oore URL in a private window.
2. Authenticate as the exact Owner email used during initialization.
3. Confirm Oore opens as Owner.
4. Open **Settings > General** and confirm **External access** reports **Trusted Proxy**.
5. Confirm **Network settings** shows the intended HTTPS Public URL and browser origin.
6. Invite a non-owner email, authenticate through the proxy as that person, and confirm the invitation becomes `active` with its assigned Oore role.

Also verify that a request fails when any one trust input is wrong: the peer is outside the allowlist, the identity header is missing, or the proof does not match.

## Troubleshooting

### Setup says the database is not migrated

`oored` has not initialized the schema. Start the daemon once, then rerun `oore setup init`.

### Setup refuses to change a ready instance

Direct initialization cannot replace a completed access mode. Do not use `--force` against a ready instance; plan the access-mode change through the supported settings and recovery workflow.

### The proxy-authenticated browser is rejected

One of the three trust checks failed. Confirm the immediate source address, exact configured email header, and backend proof at the hop that reaches `oored`.

### The user authenticates upstream but has no Oore access

The proxy email does not match an active or invited Oore user. Invite the exact email or correct the proxy claim; proxy groups do not grant roles.

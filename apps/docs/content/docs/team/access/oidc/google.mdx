Create a Google OAuth web client for the Oore frontend origin you chose. This page covers only the Google-specific fields; [configure the shared OIDC network and enablement steps](/team/access/oidc) separately.

## What you need

- A Google Cloud project
- Permission to configure the project's OAuth consent screen and credentials
- The exact Oore frontend callback ending in `/auth/callback`

## 1. Create the Google client

1. Open [Google Cloud credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen if the project does not have one:
   - choose the audience appropriate for your organization;
   - provide the required app and contact details.
3. Select **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**.
4. Choose **Web application**.
5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the one exact Oore callback you defined. Add another only when you intentionally operate another frontend origin.
6. Create the client, then copy its client ID and client secret.

If the consent configuration uses a restricted test audience, add every person who must verify sign-in.

## 2. Save Google in Oore

In Oore's **2. Identity** step, enter:

| Oore field                   | Google value                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Issuer URL**               | `https://accounts.google.com` |
| **Client ID**                | The OAuth client ID           |
| **Client secret (optional)** | The OAuth client secret       |

Select **Save changes**.

## Verify the result

Confirm Oore shows `OIDC configured: https://accounts.google.com`. After you complete the shared External Access steps and select **Turn on**, use a private window to select **Sign in with OIDC** and confirm Google returns you to the exact Oore callback.

Google's [OpenID Connect reference](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/reference) describes its issuer, endpoints, and claims.

## Troubleshooting

### Google reports `redirect_uri_mismatch`

The authorized URI is not an exact match. Compare the scheme, host, port, `/auth/callback` path, and trailing slash with the URI Oore uses.

### Google blocks a test user

The OAuth app's audience or publishing status excludes that account. Add the account to the allowed test audience or update the consent configuration.

## Next step

Return to [Configure External Access (OIDC)](/team/access/oidc) to run technical checks and enable access.

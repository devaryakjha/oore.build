title: 'Configure artifact storage'
status: implemented
description: 'Keep automatic local artifact storage or configure supported S3-compatible storage.'
---

New instances use backend-local artifact storage automatically. Keep that
default for the one-Mac topology. Configure S3 or Cloudflare R2 only when you
want the object store to receive artifact uploads and downloads.

## What you need

- An Owner or Admin account.
- For local storage, a writable directory on the backend Mac.
- For S3 or R2, an existing bucket, endpoint and region, and credentials with
  the required object permissions.

Oore does not create the bucket or manage its policy, retention, availability,
or backup.

## Configure storage

1. Open **Settings > Artifact storage**.
2. Under **Provider**, choose **Local filesystem** or
   **Object storage (S3-compatible)**.
3. For local storage, enter an absolute **Local base directory** only when you
   need to override the managed default.
4. For object storage, choose **Service** and enter **Bucket**, **Region**,
   **Endpoint (optional)** for AWS S3 or **Endpoint (required)** for the other
   services, **Access key ID**, and **Secret access key**.
5. Select **Save**.

Cloudflare R2 uses its S3-compatible endpoint and region `auto`. There is no
separate account-ID field in Oore's storage request.

Database-backed settings take precedence over a complete environment
configuration. When neither exists, Oore selects local storage. An explicitly
invalid or disabled provider fails closed instead of silently falling back.
For automation, use the generated
[Update artifact storage settings](/openapi/operations/update_artifact_storage_settings)
operation.

## Verify the result

Trigger a build that produces an artifact. Open the successful build, request a
download, and confirm the file opens. Local delivery uses a short-lived signed
backend route; S3 and R2 use a time-bound presigned provider URL.

## Troubleshooting

If saving fails, check the absolute local path or all object-store fields and
credentials. If upload succeeds but download fails, verify bucket policy,
endpoint reachability, and link expiry. The 512 MiB request limit and
single-use upload-token behavior apply to local uploads, not presigned
object-store uploads.

artifact backups separately from [Oore state backups](/operate/maintain/backups/create).

Start with a repository you trust, create one project for it, and choose
whether the pipeline lives with the repository or in Oore.

## Build from a repository

For the default Local Only path, [create a project](/build/projects/create)
from a Git repository on the backend Mac. Then choose one pipeline path:

- [Configure `.oore.yaml`](/build/pipelines/oore-yaml) when the build
  definition should travel with the commit.
- [Configure a pipeline in the UI](/build/pipelines/use-the-ui) when the
  repository does not contain an Oore workflow.

When the pipeline is ready, [trigger a build](/build/run/trigger) and follow
the build to a result you can verify.

## Add a connected source

External Access can discover repositories and receive verified webhook
events through [GitHub](/build/sources/github) or
[GitLab](/build/sources/gitlab). Creating or relinking a project remains the
decision that trusts a repository to run on a Direct macOS runner.

## Sign and distribute

- [Add Android signing](/build/sign/android) for release APKs or App Bundles.
- [Configure iOS signing](/build/sign/ios/manual) for registered-device builds.
- [Download a build artifact](/build/distribute/download), or use the
  device-specific [Android](/build/distribute/install/android) and
  [iOS](/build/distribute/install/ios) install tasks.

## Next step

[Create a project](/build/projects/create) from the repository you want Oore
to build.

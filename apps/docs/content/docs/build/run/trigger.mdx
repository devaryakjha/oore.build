title: 'Trigger a build'
status: implemented
description: 'Queue one pipeline build from the Oore UI and verify the pinned revision.'
---

Trigger a pipeline manually and confirm the exact repository revision Oore
queued. This task does not change the pipeline or its source.

## What you need

- A linked project with at least one pipeline.
- Project developer, maintainer, instance admin, or instance owner access.
- An online Direct macOS runner that is accepting new work.

## 1. Open the build dialog

Open the project and select **Run build**.

## 2. Choose what to build

1. Select the **Pipeline**.
2. Select the platforms for this run when the pipeline supports more than one.
3. Enter the **Branch** to build.
4. Add **Commit SHA (optional)** only when you need one exact revision.
5. Review **What changed? (optional)** if Oore drafted release notes.

When both branch and commit SHA are present, the commit SHA wins. Without a
commit SHA, Oore resolves the branch before it creates the queued build.

## 3. Run the build

Select **Run build** in the dialog. Oore opens the build after it has been
queued.

## Verify the result

The build detail shows its branch, pinned commit, pipeline, and selected
platforms. Follow the state and logs until the build reaches `succeeded` or
another terminal result.

## Troubleshooting

**The build waits because the Direct macOS runner is paused**

An instance owner or admin can open **Settings > Runners** and turn on
**Allow approved repositories**. This resumes new claims; it does not create a
second repository approval step.

**The build reports that the source is unavailable**

Ask an owner or admin to repair or relink the project source, then trigger a
new build. A re-run does not move an older build snapshot to a different
repository identity.

**Oore asks for a branch or commit**

Enter a branch, provide a commit SHA, or set the project's default branch.

Connected GitHub and GitLab sources can also trigger enabled pipelines from
verified webhook revisions. The HTTP contract is available in
[Create a build](/openapi/operations/create_build).

## Next step

If the build must stop before completion, [cancel the build](/build/run/cancel).

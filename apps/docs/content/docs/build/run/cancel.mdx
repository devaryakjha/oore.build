title: 'Cancel a build'
status: implemented
description: 'Cancel queued or active work and verify the build reaches canceled.'
---

Cancel one build without changing its pipeline or repository. Oore accepts
cancellation while the build is `queued`, `scheduled`, `assigned`, or
`running`.

## What you need

- Project developer, maintainer, instance admin, or instance owner access.
- A build that has not reached a terminal state.

## 1. Open the build

Open **Builds** or the project's build list, then select the build you want to
stop.

## 2. Confirm cancellation

Select **Cancel Build**. In the confirmation dialog, select **Cancel build**.

Oore marks the build `canceled` immediately. A Direct macOS runner that already
claimed the job observes that state and stops its work. Already-recorded logs
remain available until retention cleanup removes the build; an incomplete
artifact may be unavailable.

## Verify the result

The build detail shows `canceled`, and the cancel action is no longer
available.

## Troubleshooting

**The cancel action is not shown**

The build may already be `succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`, `timed_out`, or
`expired`, or your project role may not allow cancellation.

**A repeated cancellation returns a conflict**

The cancellation has already won or another terminal transition completed
first. Refresh the build and use its current state; Oore returns
`invalid_transition` instead of changing a terminal build again.

The HTTP contract is available in
[Cancel a build](/openapi/operations/cancel_build).

## Next step

Use the [build-state reference](/reference/build-states) to interpret the
terminal result.

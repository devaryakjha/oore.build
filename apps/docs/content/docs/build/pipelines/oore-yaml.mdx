title: 'Configure a repository pipeline'
status: implemented
description: 'Add and validate a repository-owned Oore pipeline in .oore.yaml.'
---

Add `.oore.yaml` to the repository so the pipeline definition is reviewed and
versioned with the code it builds. The Direct macOS runner reads the selected
file from the pinned checkout for each build.

## What you need

- A project whose repository you can edit.
- Project developer, maintainer, instance admin, or instance owner access in
  Oore.
- The `oore` operator CLI available where you edit the repository.

## 1. Add the workflow

Create `.oore.yaml` in the repository root:

```yaml
version: 1
platforms:
  - android
commands:
  pre_build:
    - flutter pub get
  build:
    - flutter build apk --release
artifacts:
  patterns:
    - build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/*.apk
```

The schema rejects unknown fields. `platforms` must contain at least one of
`android`, `ios`, or `macos`. Command stages are lists, while each
`platform_commands` override is one string.

For every field and accepted type, use the
[`.oore.yaml` reference](/reference/config/oore-yaml).

## 2. Validate the file

Run the product validator before you commit the workflow:

```bash
oore pipeline validate .oore.yaml
```

A valid file exits successfully and prints:

```text
.oore.yaml is valid
```

## 3. Create the pipeline

1. Open the project and select **Pipelines**.
2. Select **Set up a build**.
3. Under **Repository workflow found**, select the intended file if Oore found
   more than one.
4. Review the pipeline name, platforms, triggers, and artifact patterns.
5. Select **Create**.

Without an explicit config path, Oore checks `.oore.yaml` and then
`.oore.yml`. An explicitly selected path is the only path checked.

## Verify the result

Oore shows **Pipeline created** and returns to the project. Trigger a build and
confirm its logs identify the repository workflow as the configuration source.

## Troubleshooting

**Validation reports an unknown field**

Remove or correct that field. Each `platform_build_args` platform accepts a
list of strings.

**Oore reports that the selected workflow is invalid**

Fix the file at the build's pinned commit and validate it again. An invalid
selected file fails visibly; Oore does not silently use the UI configuration.

**The workflow is not discovered**

Confirm the file exists on the branch Oore is inspecting. For a workflow
outside the repository root, choose **Use a specific config file path** and
enter its repository-relative path.

## Next step

[Trigger a build](/build/run/trigger) from the validated pipeline.

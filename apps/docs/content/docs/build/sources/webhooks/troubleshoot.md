title: 'Troubleshoot source webhooks'
status: implemented
description: 'Diagnose webhook delivery, verification, and trigger-filter failures for GitHub and GitLab.'
---

Use the delivery result to find where a GitHub or GitLab webhook stopped. This
task diagnoses source delivery; it does not change repository trust or bypass
revision verification.

## What you need

- Access to the connected source in Oore.
- Access to the provider's webhook delivery history.
- A project linked to the repository and an enabled pipeline with source
  triggers.

The public endpoints are:

| Provider | Endpoint                   |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| GitHub   | `POST /v1/webhooks/github` |
| GitLab   | `POST /v1/webhooks/gitlab` |

## 1. Check whether the delivery reached Oore

Open the provider's recent webhook deliveries and inspect the latest push or
change-request event.

- GitHub's app manifest registers its webhook automatically. Do not add a
  second GitHub webhook.
- GitLab must use the **Webhook URL** and one-time **Secret token** generated
  for that exact repository in Oore.

If the provider reports a connection refusal, timeout, or DNS failure, confirm
the displayed webhook URL is reachable from the provider.

## 2. Resolve verification failures

GitHub accepts only deliveries with a valid app webhook signature and
deduplicates retries by delivery identity.

GitLab accepts only the current token for the repository named by the payload.
If the provider reports an authentication failure, create a new token from
that repository's action menu, replace the token in GitLab, and test again.

Do not reuse a GitLab token from another project, even when both projects use
the same source connection.

## 3. Check the pipeline filters

A verified delivery queues a build only when:

1. The event matches the pipeline's enabled trigger events.
2. The branch matches its branch patterns.
3. The pipeline is enabled.
4. A pull or merge request identifies an immutable revision that belongs to
   the linked repository.

Oore ignores external forks, ambiguous repository identities, and events that
do not prove a new revision. That is expected source-trust behavior, not a
request for a later repository approval.

## Verify the result

Send one new matching push or same-repository change-request revision. The
provider reports a successful delivery, and Oore creates one build pinned to
the delivered commit.

## Troubleshooting

**A successful delivery creates no build**

Compare the event and branch with the pipeline's **Triggers** settings. Then
confirm the project still links to the repository in the delivery.

**A retry appears more than once in the provider**

Use the same provider delivery rather than creating new test revisions. Oore
deduplicates a repeated verified delivery, but separate delivery identities
are separate events.

**A temporary local diagnostic needs a public URL**

A named tunnel such as Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok can illustrate whether the
provider can reach the endpoint. This is a diagnostic technique, not an
approved production deployment topology.

## Next step

[Trigger a build manually](/build/run/trigger) to separate source-delivery
problems from pipeline or runner problems.

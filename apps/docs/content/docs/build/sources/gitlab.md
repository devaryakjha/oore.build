title: 'Connect GitLab'

Connect GitLab.com or one self-managed GitLab origin. A personal access token
is the shortest path; an OAuth application is available when your organization
manages shared source authorization.

## What you need

- External Access configured for the Oore instance.
- An Oore instance owner or admin account.
- A GitLab account that can read the projects you want Oore to discover.

## 1. Open GitLab setup

Open **Sources**, select **Connect source**, then **GitLab**.

Under **GitLab host**, choose **GitLab.com** or **Self-managed GitLab**. For a
self-managed host, enter only its HTTPS origin, such as
`https://gitlab.example.com`. Do not append `/api/v4` or a group path.

## 2. Use a personal access token

Under **Authentication method**, select **Personal access token**.

Create a GitLab token with:

- `read_user`
- `read_api`
- `read_repository`

Enter it in **Access token**, then select **Verify and save GitLab source**.
Oore verifies the token before storing the source.

## 3. Sync the source

Open the saved source and select **Sync projects**. Oore follows GitLab
pagination and removes repositories that the account can no longer see.

## 4. Add a repository webhook

GitLab webhooks use a separate token for each repository:

1. On the source's repository list, open that repository's actions and select
   **Create webhook token**.
2. Confirm **Create token**.
3. Copy the displayed **Webhook URL** and **Secret token**. The token is shown
   once.
4. In that GitLab project's webhook settings, add the URL and secret.
5. Enable Push events and Merge request events.

Creating another token for the same repository immediately invalidates its
previous token.

## OAuth application alternative

Choose **OAuth application** when GitLab should own user authorization.
Register the exact callback URI shown by Oore, request only `read_api` and
`read_repository`, then enter **Client ID** and **Client secret**. Select
**Save and authorize on GitLab**, and complete **Authorize on GitLab** from the
saved source details.

## Verify the result

The GitLab source is active, **Sync projects** lists the expected repository,
and **New project** can select it. GitLab's webhook test should reach the
repository-specific URL without an authentication error.

## Troubleshooting

**Token verification fails**

Confirm the token belongs to the selected GitLab origin and includes all three
read-only scopes. Replace an expired or revoked token.

**OAuth returns to the wrong place**

Copy the callback URI shown by Oore exactly. Keep the same scheme, host, path,
and callback suffix.

**A webhook is rejected after token rotation**

Replace the old secret in that exact GitLab project's webhook settings. A
token from another repository is intentionally rejected.

## Next step

[Create a project](/build/projects/create) from the synced repository.

title: 'Configure App Store Connect signing'
status: implemented
description: 'Add App Store Connect API credentials and synchronize iOS signing profiles.'
---

Use App Store Connect API credentials when Oore should synchronize signing
assets for a pipeline. API mode still uses the Direct macOS runner's
runner-owned signing path.

## What you need

- Project developer, maintainer, instance admin, or instance owner access.
- An Apple Developer team with App Store Connect API access to the required
  certificates, profiles, bundle IDs, and devices.
- The Apple Team ID and every bundle identifier the pipeline signs.

## 1. Create an App Store Connect key

In App Store Connect, create an API key with the access required to read and
manage the pipeline's signing assets. Record:

- Key ID
- Issuer ID
- the downloaded `.p8` private key

Apple shows the private-key download once. Store it securely outside Oore as
well.

## 2. Add the API credentials

1. Open the project, edit the pipeline, and expand **iOS Signing**.
2. Turn on **Enable iOS ad hoc signing**.
3. For **Signing mode**, select
   **API (App Store Connect automation)**.
4. Enter **Apple Team ID** and the **Bundle identifiers**.
5. Enter **API key ID** and **API issuer ID (UUID)**.
6. Upload **App Store Connect key (.p8)**.
7. Select **Save**.

Use **Hybrid (manual cert + API automation)** only when the pipeline needs a
manually uploaded certificate together with API-synchronized profiles.

## 3. Synchronize profiles

Open the pipeline for editing and select **Sync Profiles** under
**Registered iOS Devices**. Oore synchronizes signing assets for the configured
bundle identifiers and reports warnings separately from updated profiles.

## Verify the result

Oore shows an **iOS signing sync completed** message with the number of
profiles updated. The pipeline's signing summary shows the stored API key and
profiles for the configured bundle identifiers.

## Troubleshooting

**Sync cannot find a profile**

Confirm the Apple Team ID and bundle identifier are exact, and that the API key
can access the corresponding certificate and provisioning profile.

**The API key is rejected**

Confirm the Key ID, Issuer ID, and `.p8` file came from the same App Store
Connect key and that the key is still active.

**The build stops before checkout**

API synchronization does not remove the active-login prerequisite for Apple
signing. Log in to the Direct macOS runner account and retry.

## Next step

[Register an iOS test device](/build/distribute/ios-devices) and synchronize
profiles before the device's build.

title: 'Configure manual iOS signing'
status: implemented
description: 'Upload a certificate and provisioning profiles for runner-owned iOS signing.'
---

Configure one pipeline with a `.p12` certificate and a provisioning profile
for every bundle it signs. The Direct macOS runner performs the signing; the
repository's child processes do not receive the signing files, password, or
Oore signing capability token.

## What you need

- Project developer, maintainer, instance admin, or instance owner access.
- An iOS pipeline that produces an IPA.
- The [prepared certificate, profiles, Team ID, and bundle
  IDs](/build/sign/ios/certificates).
- An active macOS login session for the Direct macOS runner account while the
  iOS build runs.

## 1. Open iOS signing

Open the project, edit the pipeline, and expand **iOS Signing**.

## 2. Add the manual assets

1. Turn on **Enable iOS ad hoc signing**.
2. For **Signing mode**, select
   **Manual (.p12 + provisioning profiles)**.
3. Enter **Apple Team ID**.
4. Enter **Bundle identifiers**, with the main application first and one
   extension bundle ID per line.
5. Upload **Distribution certificate (.p12)** and enter **P12 password**.
6. Under **Provisioning profiles by bundle ID**, upload the matching
   `.mobileprovision` file for each bundle.
7. Select **Save**.

For automation, use the generated
[Update iOS signing configuration](/openapi/operations/update_pipeline_ios_signing)
operation.

## 3. Run the iOS build

Keep the Direct macOS runner account logged in, then trigger the pipeline.
Oore uses a temporary job keychain and attempts to clean up its signing state
after the job. Profiles remain in the private job workspace.

## Verify the result

The build reaches `succeeded` and produces an IPA whose artifact metadata
shows the expected bundle identifier and signing export method. An ad hoc or
release-testing IPA with complete current metadata has an **Install** action.

## Troubleshooting

**The build stops before checkout and asks for login**

Log in to the Direct macOS runner account, keep that session active, and retry
the build.

**Oore reports a missing profile**

Upload one provisioning profile for every bundle identifier, including
extensions, and confirm each profile uses the same Apple Team ID.

**The IPA is not install-ready**

Confirm the export method supports registered-device installation and that the
main bundle identifier is covered by the signing profiles. Rebuild with the
current runner after correcting the mapping.

## Next step

[Register the test device](/build/distribute/ios-devices) before producing the
IPA that device will install.

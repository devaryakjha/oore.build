status: implemented
description: 'Upload an Android keystore and produce a runner-signed APK or App Bundle.'
---

Add a keystore to one pipeline so the Direct macOS runner can sign and verify
the APKs or App Bundles produced by that pipeline.

## What you need

- Project developer, maintainer, instance admin, or instance owner access.
- A working Android pipeline that produces an APK or App Bundle.
- A `.jks` or `.keystore` file, its store password, key alias, and key
  password.

> **Warning — Keep an independent backup**
>
> Store the keystore and passwords outside Oore in a secure backup. Losing the
> application signing key can prevent future updates to an existing Android
> application.

## 1. Create a keystore if needed

If you do not already have an application signing key, create one with the JDK
`keytool`:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore my-release-key.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias my-key-alias
```

Record the store password, alias, and key password when prompted.

## 2. Add the signing profile

1. Open the project, then open the pipeline for editing.
2. Expand **Android Signing**.
3. Turn on **Enable release signing**.
4. Select the **Release keystore (.jks)** file.
5. Enter **Release key alias**, **Release store password**, and
   **Release key password**.
6. Select **Save**.

Use **Enable debug signing** only when that pipeline's supported Flutter build
command produces a debug artifact that needs a specific key.
For automation, use the generated
[Update Android signing configuration](/openapi/operations/update_pipeline_android_signing)
operation.

## 3. Run a signed build

Trigger the pipeline with one Android variant. Repository child processes do
not receive signing files, passwords, or Oore signing capability tokens. For a
supported Flutter Android build command, the runner-owned signer signs and
verifies the produced artifacts outside the repository checkout.

## Verify the result

The build reaches `succeeded`, and its log includes an `android-sign` step
followed by a signed-and-verified artifact count. Download an APK and inspect
its certificate:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs my-app-release.apk
```

For an App Bundle, use:

```bash
jarsigner -verify -strict my-app-release.aab
```

## Troubleshooting

**The signing profile is rejected**

Confirm the uploaded file, store password, key alias, and key password belong
to the same keystore.

**The build reports mixed Android variants**

Use one debug or release variant per pipeline run. Do not mix debug and
release Flutter build commands in the same run.

**Repository Gradle code expects managed signing variables**

Remove that dependency. Managed signing values are not repository build inputs
and are scrubbed from repository child processes.

## Next step

[Configure the Gradle boundary](/build/sign/android/gradle) when the repository
also signs release builds on developer machines.
